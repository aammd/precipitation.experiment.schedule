Hello everyone, 

Reading Diane's email about the possible design of the experiment got
me thinking about how it might look, and I wanted to share my thoughts
with you.

How much time might a bromeliad take to dry out? I saw an opportunity
to get a crude answer to this question this year on Cardoso when we
had a period of heavy rain followed by a very long, dry period of
nearly a month.  I went to a patch of bromeliads and collected a range
of plants from large to small, all from within 2m of each other.  I
tried to get all the water out, and measured actual and maximum
volumes for all of them.  If we make the assumption that after the
heavy rain all the plants were full, then we can calculate how much
each has lost to evaporation and examine this as a function of plant
size.

(actually do that)

I wanted to examine the effects of watering in a binomial
distribution, and
