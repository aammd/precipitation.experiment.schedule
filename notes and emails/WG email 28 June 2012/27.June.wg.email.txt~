Hello everyone, 

Reading Diane's email about the possible design of the experiment got
me thinking about how it might look, and I wanted to share my thoughts
with you.

How much time might a bromeliad take to dry out? I saw an opportunity
to get a crude answer to this question this year on Cardoso when we
had a period of heavy rain followed by a very long, dry period of
nearly a month.
